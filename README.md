# InstructionProcessorSimulator
This project was developed as part of the "Computer Architecture and Organization" course to provide a hands-on experience with the fundamental concepts of instruction processing. The simulator allows you to explore the inner workings of a simplified processor, focusing on instruction fetching, decoding, and execution.
